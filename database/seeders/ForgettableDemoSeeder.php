/**
 * Seeds a realistic mix of subjects with related records across every
 * Forgettable model so a developer trying the package locally can
 * immediately see `retention:forget` do something meaningful.
 *
 * The seeder creates three subjects:
 *
 *  - "alice-01" — typical case: own user row, profile, two orders,
 *                 one ticket they reported, one ticket assigned to them.
 *  - "bob-02"   — same shape, exists to prove the sweep does not
 *                 over-reach across subjects.
 *  - "carol-03" — has only orders (no profile/tickets) to exercise
 *                 the "partial coverage" path.
 *
 * Run:
 *
 *   php artisan db:seed --class="Ginkelsoft\\DataRetention\\Database\\Seeders\\ForgettableDemoSeeder"
 *   php artisan retention:forget alice-01 --dry-run
 *   php artisan retention:forget alice-01
 *
 * After the run alice-01 is gone (her user row), her profile is
 * anonymized in place, her orders are deleted, and her tickets are
 * deleted. Bob and Carol are untouched. The action is recorded in the
 * `forget_log` table with `subject_hash = SHA-256("subject|alice-01|...")`.
